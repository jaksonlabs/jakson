 # The carbonian guide to enter the dark side. 

Contribution can be done by the following forms:

* [Reporting bugs or suggesting features]
* [Contributing pull requests](#contributing-pull-requests)

## Reporting bugs

To report a bug or suggest a feature please follow the guide lines from stackoverflow about how to share a code 
to reproduce the bug or the feature.
[How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

#### Check if the issue has opened before.

Please take sometime and search to check to see if the issue has been opened before.

#### Specify the platform

Currently libcarbon runs on linux, though it would not hurt to provide the full information
about the code environmment (OS, device)

* Operating system
* Device (including architecture, e.g. x86, x86_64, arm, etc.)


## Contributing pull requests

So you believe you have found what can make libcarbon the second best invention after the Jazz music (if it is not already)
and you want to share it with the world, please first make sure:
* It is a plus for the project (would increase efficiencey, ........ etc).
* Test cases, now you could convince the world with correctness of your feature,
currently libcarbon uses [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md)
.

As best practice:
* It would be nice if your pull request will not cause a merge conflict with the main branch.

#### Code style:

* case is snake case
