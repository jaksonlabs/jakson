## Null and Nil
In carbon, there are two way to express absence of data, `null` and `nil`. The first one, `null`, is a
mapping of the Json constant `null`, and is used to express non-present data by the user, e.g., by the
Json string `"x": null`. In contrast, the second one, `nil` is used to express absence of data that is
not only annotated as non-present, but in fact not contained. In no cases, the user can express a `nil`
with its input, but will receive a `nil` ("not in list") value whenever the user `queries` for non-existing
data by a [dot path expression](traversals-queries/path-eval/path-eval.md).

The reason for differencing between `null` and `nil` is to enable clear semantic whether a particular
[dot path expression](traversals-queries/path-eval/path-eval.md) evaluates to a value that is stored
within the record and which is annotated with absence of data by the user (i.e., using a `null`),
or to a value that is not contained in the dataset (i.e., a `nil` is return).

To ephasis the differences and importance of `nil` and `null`, consider the following example

```json
{
    "x": null
}
```

Using a [dot path expression](traversals-queries/path-eval/path-eval.md) asking for the value of
the property `"x"` will result in `null` since `"x"` is a valid path that evaluates to a particular
value. In contrast, asking for the value of an non-existing property `"y"` will result in `nil` since
`"y"` does not exist.
