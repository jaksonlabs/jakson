/**
 * This type is for variable-length unsigned integer types.
 *
 * The encoding uses a dedicated byte (called marker) to identify the number of subsequent bytes that holding the
 * actual value: if the first byte read is...
 *      - ... 'c', then the next byte contains an unsigned integer value of 8bit.
 *      - ... 'd', then the next 2 bytes contain an unsigned integer value of 16bit.
 *      - ... 'i', then the next 4 bytes contain an unsigned integer value of 32bit.
 *      - ... 'l', then the next 8 bytes contain an unsigned integer value of 64bit.
 *
 * This implementation supports variable-length encoding to the maximum of unsigned integers of
 * 64bit (fixed-sized) requiring constant 1 byte more than the standard C type.
 *
 * Note that size requirements for this kind of variable-length encoding is (relatively) huge;
 * the encoding requires as least 12.5% additional storage (to encode 64bit integers) and at most
 * 100.0% (!) additional storage (to encode 8bit integers). The benefit of marker-based variable-length encoding is that
 * read-/write performance is superior to byte-stream based variable-length encoding (see <code>uintvar_stream</code>),
 * and that size requirements payoff for values larger than 65536. Faster read/write performance compared to byte-stream
 * based variable-length encoding comes by the fact that after determination of actual number of bytes to reads
 * (i.e., the marker), there is no interpretation overhead to read the actual value while in byte-stream based encoding
 * each subsequent byte must be inspect (on whether it is the last byte in the stream) before reading its contained
 * value (after some byte shift operations).
 *
 * Rule of thumb:
 *      - if fixed-length types are a good choice, and...
 *          - ... if speed matters, use fast-types of the C library (e.g., <code>uint_fast32_t</code>)
 *          - ... if space matters, use fix-types of the C library (e.g., <code>uint32_t</code>)
 *      - if variable-length types are a good choice, and...
 *          - ... if space shall be minimized in exchange of read/write performance, use <code>uintvar_stream_t</code>
 *          - ... if read/write performance shall be maximized in exchange of space, use <code>uintvar_marker_t</code>
